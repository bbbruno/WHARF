ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set

Abstract:
---------
Recordings of 17 volunteers endowed with a single wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer performing 14 Human Motion Primitives (HMP). Human Motion Primitives allow for the recognition of mechanical, location-independent Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

Data Set Information:
---------------------
The "ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set" is a public collection of labelled accelerometer data recordings to be used for the creation and validation of acceleration models of simple human activities, called Human Motion Primitives (HMP).

The dataset is composed of the recordings of 14 HMP (referring to 5 ADL), performed by a total of 17 volunteers:
- ADL "Toileting"
	1.  Brush own teeth
	2.  Comb own hair
- ADL "Trasferring"
	3.  Get up from the bed
	4.  Lie down on the bed
	5.  Sit down on a chair
	6.  Stand up from a chair
- ADL "Feeding"
	7.  Drink from a glass
	8.  Eat with fork and knife
	9.  Eat with spoon
	10. Pour water into a glass
- ADL "Ability to use telephone"
	11. Use the telephone
- ADL "Mode of transportation (indoor)"
	12. Climb the stairs
	13. Descend the stairs
	14. Walk

Detailed documentation about the dataset is provided in the files README.TXT and MANUAL.TXT inside the Data Folder.

Attribute Information:
----------------------
Each file in the dataset follows the following naming convention:
Accelerometer-[START_TIME]-[HMP]-[VOLUNTEER]
where:
- [START_TIME]: timestamp of the starting moment of the recording
                in the format [YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS]
- [HMP]:        name of the HMP performed in the recorded trial, following
                the naming convention specified in Section 2 of this manual
- [VOLUNTEER]:  identification code of the volunteer performing the recorded
                motion in the format [gN] where:
                - "g": indicates the gender of the volunteer
                       (m -> male, f -> female)
                - "N": indicates the progressive number associated to the
                       volunteer
 
Each record of a file reports: 
 - acceleration along the x axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the y axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the z axis of the accelerometer
